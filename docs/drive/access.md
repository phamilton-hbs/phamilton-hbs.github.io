# Managing Access to Materials

+ [Folder Access for Faculty and TFs](#folder-access-for-faculty-and-tfs)
+ [Access for Students](#access-for-students)

Permissions to the materials on Drive are managed using Google Groups. There are three primary sets of users:
+ `DSM Faculty` (`dsm-faculty-hbs@googlegroups.com`) - Course faculty and anyone who regularly makes edits to course materials, such as the Research Associate(s) working on the course. This group has edit access to all materials.
+ `DSM TFs` (`dsm-tfs@googlegroups.com`) - Teaching fellows who need to review but not edit materials. This group has view access to all materials, and edit access to some specific materials.
+ `DSM Students` (`dsm-students@googlegroups.com`) - Students currently enrolled in the course. This group begins the semester with no access to any of the materials on Drive, and we release materials to them throughout the semester. 

These Google Groups should be managed by the owner of the `dsmfaculty@gmail.com` account (most likely the course RA). The owner of the account can manage all of the Google Groups here: https://groups.google.com/my-groups.

## Folder Access for Faculty and TFs

The `DSM Faculty` and `DSM TFs` groups are already shared with edit and view access (respectively) to the root `DSM` folder. Any files or folders that are created within this directory automatically inherit its permissions. This means that when a new course folder is created within `DSM` for an upcoming semester of the course, the `DSM Faculty` and `DSM TFs` groups will automatically have the appropriate level of access to the folder. 

When a new faculty (or TF) joins the course, add them to the appropriate Google Group by following the steps below. This will automatically grant them access to all the course materials on Drive.
1. On the home page for the group, click `Members` (under the `People` tab on the left). 
2. Click the `Add members` button at the top of the page.
3. Add the Gmail account name of the new member(s) in the `Group members` box. 
4. Turn on the `Directly add members` button in the bottom of the window.
5. Click `Add members`.

Here is an GIF showing these steps:

## Access for Students

Student accounts do not need to be manually added to the `DSM Students` group. Instead, the assignment sheet for the first class should instruct students to sign up for the course Google Group themselves. For example, in the Fall 2022 RC iteration of the course, the assignment sheet for Class 0 - R Bootcamp (direct link [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13lUz-DBs6WOapCtGQBM2aKbTS4oDDgSrUtFdS5JXNhk/edit?usp=sharing)) contains the following instruction:

> You will need a Google account for the course. You may use a pre-existing one, or create a new one for the course. Once you have an account, join the course Google Group by opening the link below and clicking “Join group”. 
https://groups.google.com/g/dsm-students

This link will lead students to the public home page for the `DSM Students` group, which they can join by clicking `Join group`:

At the start of the semester, the `DSM Students` group should not be shared with any of the materials on Drive. Then, at the start of each week, the materials linked in the assignment sheet should be shared *with view access* to `dsm-students@googlegroups.com`. Once those materials are shared with that address, the links in the assignment sheet will become active to the students. See the previous section for instructions on how to share materials with view access to the student group.
