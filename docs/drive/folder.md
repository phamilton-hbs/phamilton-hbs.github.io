# Course Folder Structure

With such a large team of faculty, teaching fellows, and research associates working on the course, it is imperative that the Drive folder is well organized and maintained. The folder should be intuitively designed such that it is obvious where all materials are stored within the folder. 

The dsmfaculty@gmail.com account owns the master folder for the course called `DSM` (direct link [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cBOCc2-X58ySGGwkP85ArtoCfRuiAPar?usp=sharing)). You may or may not have access to this folder, depending on your role in the course. This folder contains the following subfolders:

+ `!Archived` - A folder with archived course folders from previous iterations of the course. You can peruse these folders to see how we have organized materials in the past.
+ `Templates` - Template files for all of the materials we use in the course, such as Colab notebooks, Google Polls (for the tutorials), and assignment sheets.
+ Current course folders (e.g. `RC DSM (Fall 2022)`) - These folders are used to manage the Drive materials for any current iterations of the course. When creating a folder for a new iteration of the course, follow the naming convention used in previous semesters.

To see how course folders are organized, here are the contents of the `RC DSM (Fall 2022)` folder:

As you can see, there are four primary subfolders: 
+ `!Temp`, which is used to store and share temporary documents to prevent the rest of the course folder from getting cluttered; 
+ `Admin`, which stores administrative documents such as the syllabus, course overview note, course calendar, etc.; 
+ `Class Materials`, which contains subfolders for each class in the course; and 
+ `Tutorials`, which contains all of the tutorial exercises that the students prepare outside of class as part of the course prework. 

The majority of the content resides in `Class Materials`, which contains a subfolder for each of the fourteen class sessions (plus the pre-course bootcamp):

Each one of these class folders contains all the necessary materials (documents, data, code notebooks, etc.) for the relevant class session. Let's look into one of these folders, for example `Class Materials/Class 3 - Summary Statistics & Visualization II (Lexoo)` (link [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10ubhVgj13FVumKkdIQIsQwY7Lr3QRQF6?usp=sharing)).

</kbd>

This contains the following:
+ `data` - All of the data sets for the Lexoo case, which is just the case data the students will analyze during class (`lexoo_transactions.csv`).
+ `documents` - The Lexoo case, different faculty teaching plans, slides shown in class, etc. 
+ `notebooks` - All of the Colab notebooks for Lexoo. In this case, there is a starter notebook for the case that will be shared with students during class (`Class 3: Lexoo.ipynb`), and an accompanying finisher notebook with the suggested answers (`Class 3: Lexoo (FINISHER).ipynb`).
+ `Class 3: Assignment Sheet` - The assignment sheet for Class 3 that is given to the students. 

The next section describes how all of these materials are organized within each assignment sheet.
