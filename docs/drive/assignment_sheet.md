# Assignment Sheets

[Releasing the Notebooks](#releasing-the-notebooks)


---

Each class folder within the `Class Materials` directory should contain the assignment sheet for that class. This is a Google Doc that contains complete instructions for the students to prepare for class. It contains links to all the materials the students will need. The template for the assignment sheet can be found in the `DSM/Templates` directory (direct link [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/116phsRHXiP0hdA39Srd94J5a3yrFZgtl?usp=sharing)). As an example, here is the assignment sheet for `Class 5 - Analysis of Experiments (Yelp)` from the Fall 2022 RC DSM course:

<kbd>
<img src="\..\_media\yelp_assignment.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/>
</kbd>

This class includes all of the following content:
+ A case for the students to read before class (`Experimentation at Yelp`);
+ A Colab notebook accompanying the case that students are expected to work through *before* class (`Experimentation at Yelp (Prework).ipynb`);
+ A pre-reading on causal inference (`4. Causal Inference from dsm.business`);
+ A tutorial on causal inference (`Class 5 Tutorial: Experimentation`); and
+ A Colab notebook that students are expected to work through *during* class, which they will access at dsm.business/colab/class5.

To create this assignment sheet, we start with the template stored in `DSM/Templates`, which we will copy to `RC DSM (Fall 2022)/Class Materials/Class 5 - Analysis of Experiments (Yelp)` and rename:

Next, within our newly created assignment sheet, we fill in the Before and During Class assignment sections, as well as the list of materials students will need to complete these steps:

</kbd>

Finally, the last step is to add in the appropriate links for the materials in the Materials section. 
+ The link for the case itself will be provided in an email from case services at the start of the semester. It takes the form `https://hbsp.harvard.edu/...`.
+ The prework notebook accompanying the case (`Class 5: Experimentation at Yelp (Prework).ipynb`) is stored in the `notebooks` folder of `Class 5 - Analysis of Experiments (Yelp)`. To get the link for the notebook, right click this file, select `Get link`, and then click `Copy link` (see GIF below). Note that we want the link for the base notebook, not the version marked with `(FINISHER)` (which is just for the teaching team).

+ The link to the reading can be retrieved fron the [dsm.business](https://dsm.business/) site. Alternatively, the reading can be provided as a PDF published by case services.
+ The tutorial for the class is stored in the `RC DSM (Fall 2022)/Tutorials/quizzes` folder. To retrieve the link, navigate to this folder, then right click on the Google Poll file, select `Get link`, and click `Copy link`  (see GIF below).

+ The final file is the Colab notebook the students work through during class, which is saved in the `notebooks` folder (`Class 5: Experimentation at Yelp.ipynb`). For in-class notebooks we do not directly provide a link in the assignment sheet, but instead distribute them using a re-direct link through the course website (in this case, `dsm.business/colab/class5`). This process is described in the section [Redirect Links](../website/cpanel.md#redirect-links). 


## Releasing the Notebooks

Although the links to the Colab notebooks are now in the assignment sheet, these notebooks have not yet been shared with the students. This means that if the students were to click the links at this stage, they would recieve a "permission denied" message. To provide students with access to a notebook (or any other file type on Drive), the file simply needs to be shared with (`dsm-students@googlegroups.com`). This is a Google Group that contains all students in the course (described further in the next section). To provide access to a file:
+ Right click the file and select `Share`.
+ Type the address of the gmail account or Google Group into the `Add people and groups` bar.
+ Set the appropriate level of access (`Viewer`, `Commenter`, or `Editor`); in this case we want to share with view access.
+ Uncheck the `Notify people` box.
+ Click `Share`.

Here are these steps applied to the prework notebook for the Yelp case:

</video>

Now the link in the assignment sheet to the prework notebook is live to the students, so it would open were they to click on it. 

For all materials used in the Before Class section of the assignment sheet, access to students should be provided at the same time the assignment sheet is distributed to the students. That way students are able to access everything they need to complete the prework. Materials in the During Class section are typically only released at the start of class so that students cannot work ahead. For example, the `Class 5: Experimentation at Yelp.ipynb` notebook would not be shared with the students until the start of the relevant class session. This means that the link in the assignment sheet (`dsm.business/colab/class5`) will not work for students until the very start of class. Typically, it is the responsibility of the RA for the course to release the in-class notebook at the start of class.
