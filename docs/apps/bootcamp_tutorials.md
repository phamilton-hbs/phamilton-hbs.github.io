# Bootcamp Tutorials

The `R BOOTCAMP` section of the dsm.business site (starting [here](https://dsm.business/00_bootcamp/01_rbasics/rbasics.html)) contains embedded R tutorials built using a tool called `learnr`. These tutorials are managed in the `bootcamp_exercises` repository in the course GitHub organization (direct link: https://code.harvard.edu/DSM/bootcamp_exercises). Like the Shiny apps, these are also published through shinyapps.io. 

To learn how to create `learnr` tutorials, work through the [guide here](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/). These tutorials are published through shinyapps.io in the same way that Shiny apps are published.
