# Start Here

The purpose of this page is to onboard new team members to the Data Science for Managers course. The intended audience is faculty, teaching fellows, and other support staff (such as FSSs or RAs) who work on the course.

The materials for DSM are primarily managed on Google Drive, so you will need a Google account. To get access to our Drive materials, provide your gmail address to the current RA for the course. They will give you access by adding your account to the DSM Google Group, after which you will be able to access the course folder on Drive (`DSM`) [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cBOCc2-X58ySGGwkP85ArtoCfRuiAPar?usp=sharing). Although most of the materials are managed on Drive, there are several other platforms that we rely on throughout the course:
+ Canvas is used to distribute assignment sheets to students and manage the course calendar;
+ The course website ([dsm.business](https://dsm.business/)) is a browser-based textbook that contains assigned readings for class;
+ The [DSM GitHub organization](https://code.harvard.edu/DSM) is used to manage our web applications, the back end of the course website, etc.

Most faculty and staff involved in the course will only ever use the Drive folder and Canvas. The website and GitHub repository are primarily maintained by the course RA. 

To get a sense for the different types of materials we assign to students, we will go through the assignment sheet for a typical class session - the *Experimentation at Yelp* case. This class covers the analysis of experiments and introduces the students to causal inference. The assignment sheet for the Fall 2022 version of the class (link [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18GQJAplwDQEeq8OYavMI2LeO9IhK3UOdelyeMjTmOkw/edit?usp=sharing)) is as follows:

The pre-work for our classes adheres to the following progression: 

1. First, the students read about a concept and see how it is applied in R on the [dsm.business](https://dsm.business/) site (or alternatively they read the published module notes, which are identical to dsm.business); 
2. Next, a video tutorial guides the students through a practice problem in R; and 
3. Finally, they work through a problem in R on their own. This last step is either analyzing the data for a case, or working through an additional practice problem within the tutorial. 

For the Yelp class, the students are assigned a reading from the causal inference section of the [dsm.business](https://dsm.business/) site. This reading introduces students to the basics of analyzing randomized experiments. The reading discusses this topic at a conceptual level, and also shows how to apply these concepts in R to a real data set. Next the students work through the tutorial on experimentation, which allows them to apply what they learned in the reading. The tutorials are Google Polls that contain:
+ Conceptual questions on the reading;
+ A video (with an accompanying code notebook) where an instructor walks through an applied problem along with the students; and
+ (For some classes) a final set of questions for the students to work through on their own. The Yelp case has a data set that the students need to analyze to prepare for class, so for the Yelp class the tutorial does not have these additional questions. For cases that do *not* have data the students need to prepare before class (*e.g.*, the Department of Developmental Services (DDS)), the tutorial does have these additional practice questions.  

Next the students read the assigned case, and the last step of the prework is to work through the code notebook that accompanies the case. You can access that notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1g-iF2sZ5Wr39jTk4jFEacWgYuB9hXf7X?usp=sharing). As you can see, the notebook is divided into two tracks: an "unguided" track for students who want to push themselves, and a "guided" track for students who want more explicit instructions on how to analyze the case data. 

Finally, for certain classes we have an additional code notebook that we release to students during the middle of class. For the Yelp case, we have the students work through a sub-group analysis halfway through class. This notebook is not live to the students until the appropriate time so that they cannot work ahead.
