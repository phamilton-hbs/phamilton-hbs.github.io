# Bootcamp Quizzes

The R bootcamp at the top of the dsm.business site contains three quizzes that are administered as Google Polls. These polls are stored in the directory `DSM/Bootcamp Quizzes`. As students work through the bootcamp, their responses to these quizzes will be automatically recorded in the Google Sheets marked with `(Responses)` in the `DSM/Bootcamp Quizzes` directory:

The first quiz (`R Basics - Quiz #1`) collects the students' full name, gmail address, and HBS email address. This information is important because it allows us to connect each student with their gmail account. You will need this crosswalk to verify that each student completed the bootcamp quizzes and the tutorials throughout the course.
